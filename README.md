# BH-SPDNet
We generate synthetic block-hierarchical (BH) financial market returns data for the testing of the SPDNet with Riemannian batch normalisation.

The nested price return process is an adaptation/parameterised version of the general model proposed by Hierarchically Nested Factor Model from Multivariate Data (Tumminello \emph{et al.}, 2007) https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/78/30006 and expanded on in Agglomerative Likelihood Clustering (Ylebi and Gebbie, 20021) https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/ac3661 with code repo: https://github.com/lyelibi/timeseries_generator

The basic architecture of the SPDNet with Riemannian batch normalisation is informed by the work of Brooks et al. (2019) in Second-Order Networks in pytorch https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-26980-7_78; http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02414.
